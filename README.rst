Build
-----

Execute the following command():

.. code::

  > ./gradlew build

This will build three artifacts:  print-servlet-xxx.war, print-lib.jar, print-standalone.jar

The `build` also builds the documentation in the `docs/build/site` folder.  To deploy the documentation it should simply be copied to the gh-pages
branch and then committed GitHub will automatically build the updated site at: http://mapfish.github.io/mapfish-print/

If you only want to build the docs simply run

.. note::

   The test (part of the build) requires the 'Liberation Sans' font, witch can be downloaded
   `here <https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Liberation-Sans>`_.

.. code::

  > ./gradlew docs:build

or run build in the docs directory

Deploy
------

The following command will build and upload all artifacts to the maven central repository.

.. code::

  > ./gradlew uploadArchives -DsshPassphrase=...

You can as well generate a docker image using this command:

.. code::

  > ./gradlew createDocker

If you want to force the version to something custom, you can define the DOCKER_VERSION environment
variable.

-----------------

Create Eclipse project metadata:

.. code::

  > ./gradlew eclipse
